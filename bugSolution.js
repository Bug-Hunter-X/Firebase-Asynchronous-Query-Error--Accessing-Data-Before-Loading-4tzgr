The solution involves checking if the data exists before attempting to access specific properties. The code utilizes optional chaining and nullish coalescing to gracefully handle cases where data is not yet available or is structured differently than expected. 
```javascript
const db = firebase.database();
const query = db.ref('users').orderByChild('score').limitToFirst(1);

query.on('value', (snapshot) => {
  const topUser = snapshot.val();
  const userName = topUser?.name ?? 'No user found'; //Optional chaining and nullish coalescing
  console.log(userName);
});
```
